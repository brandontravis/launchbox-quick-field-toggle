---

## Post Content:

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm excited to share a plugin I've been working on that solves a workflow problem that's been bugging me for a while.

### The Problem

If you're like me and use custom fields to organize your library (tracking backlogs, tagging award winners, marking "now playing" games, etc.), you know the pain:

**Right-click → Edit → Custom Fields tab → scroll → find field → change value → OK → repeat for next game...**

It's tedious, especially when you're going through your library tagging games or managing a play queue.

### The Solution: QuickFieldToggle

**QuickFieldToggle** adds your custom field actions directly to the right-click context menu. One click. Done.

**[📸 SCREENSHOT: Show the context menu with Play Queue submenu expanded, similar to your existing screenshot]**

### What It Does

✅ **Single-click field toggling** - Toggle any custom field on/off instantly  
✅ **Visual indicators** - See checkmarks showing current state  
✅ **Multi-field actions** - "Move to Now Playing" can set Now Playing AND remove from Backlog in one click  
✅ **Multi-value picker** - For semicolon-separated fields, pick values from a submenu  
✅ **Conditional menus** - Show "Nintendo Tools" only for Nintendo games  
✅ **Custom icons** - Use platform icons, playlist icons, or your own  
✅ **Hot reload** - Change config without restarting LaunchBox  
✅ **100% JSON config** - No coding required to customize  

### Example Use Cases

- **Play Queue Management** - "Move to Now Playing" / "Move to Backlog" / "Move to On Deck"
- **Award Tracking** - Quick-add award nominations from your existing values
- **Platform-Specific Tags** - "First Party" toggle that only shows for Nintendo games
- **Discovery Features** - Toggle "Discovery Bin" or "The Best" flags
- **Anything you can think of!**

### Download

**GitHub:** https://github.com/brandontravis/launchbox-quick-field-toggle
